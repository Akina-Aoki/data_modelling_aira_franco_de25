# Window functions

## 1. Core concept (what’s happening)

- `AVG(salary)` computes an aggregate
- `OVER (...)` turns it into a window function
- `PARTITION` BY department defines which rows participate in each average
- Every row keeps its original values, plus the computed average
- This avoids `GROUP BY`, which would collapse rows.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- use multiple rows to calculate the value for *EACH ROW*
- use OVER clause
- for example, window function can by used to produce the column *avg_salary_by_department* below: 

| employee | department | salary | avg_salary_by_department |
|---------|------------|--------|--------------------------|
| Alice   | Sales      | 40 000 | 42 500                   |
| Bob     | Sales      | 45 000 | 42 500                   |
| Carol   | IT         | 50 000 | 52 500                   |
| Dave    | IT         | 55 000 | 52 500                   |
| Emma    | HR         | 38 000 | 38 000                   |

- while aggregate functions collapses multiple rows into one row
- aggregation functions use GROUP BY clause
- for example, aggregation function can be used to produce the summary statistics by department below: 

| department | avg_salary |
|-----------|-----------:|
| Sales     | 42 500     |
| IT        | 52 500     |
| HR        | 38 000     |
