## 3. Theoretical questions

a) What are the differences between first, second, third normal forms?

b) Can a normalized design still have flaws? Can you come up with example where this might happen?

c) If a > b and b > c, then a > c. What could this pattern be called?

d) When is ternary relationship needed?

e) In general how far do you need to normalize your design?

f) What's the purpose of normalizations?

g) Is a ternary relationship a bridge table
